<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<p>Question: the script doesnt run on my machine</p>
<p>Hint: if you use this service accross domains you can have cross domain
errors which keep the services from functioning properly (i.e. it is
best to run the REST api on the same machine as your web app that uses
it).</p>
