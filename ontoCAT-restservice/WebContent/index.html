<h1>Welcome the REST version of OntoCat</h1>
<h2>What to do with the service:</h2>
<li>A full list of services is available at
<a href="rest?_wadl">http://localhost:8080/ontocat/rest?_wadl</a>
<li>For playing around with the server we use <a
	href="http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/">http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/</a>
<li>See <a href="http://www.ontocat.org">http://www.ontocat.org</a> for full explanation of the OntoCAT package and other APIs on Java and R.
	
<h2>Example web interface for searching</h2>

Type in the box below and behind the scenes OntoCAT will search and autocomplete.
<br/>
<select name="ontocatsearch" onfocus="showOntocatInput(this); self.blur(); return false;"></select>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<p>Question: the rest service doesn't run on my web site</p>
<p>Hint: if you use this service accross domains you can have cross domain
errors which keep the services from functioning properly (i.e. it is
best to run the REST api on the same host as your web app that uses
it).</p>
