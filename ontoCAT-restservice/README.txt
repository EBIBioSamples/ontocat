This is the first try on an ontoCAT RESTfull service.
 * Just run OntoCatServer
 * Then browse to http://localhost:9000/ontocat/ontologies
 * You will get a text listing of ontologies.
 * (note: your browser may show an error; view the source of the page to make sure).
 * This work was build with http://cxf.apache.org/docs/jax-rs.html
 
 A full list of services is available at
