(*Investigation defines self-contained units of study. For

				of actions (ProtoclApplications), subjects of observation
				(ObservableTarget), traits of observation (ObservableFeature), and/or

				experiment and METABASE:Study.*)

(*OntologySource defines a reference to a an existing ontology or
				controlled vocabulary from which well-defined and stable (ontology) terms
				can be obtained. For instance: MO, GO, EFO, MP, HPO, UMLS, MeSH, etc. Use of
				existing ontologies/vocabularies is recommended to harmonize phenotypic
				feature and value descriptions. The OntologySource class maps to
				FuGE::OntologySource, MAGE-TAB::TermSourceREF.*)

(*OntologyTerm defines references to a single entry (term) from
				an ontology or a controlled vocabulary. Other data entities can reference to
				this OntologyTerm to harmonize naming of concepts. Each term should have a
				local, unique label within the investigation. Good practice is to label it
				'sourceid:term', e.g. 'MO:cell' If no suitable ontology term exists then one
				can define new terms locally (in which case there is no formal accession for
				the term limiting its use for cross-investigation queries). In those cases
				the local name should be repeated in both term and termAccession. Maps to
				FuGE::OntologyIndividual; in MAGE-TAB there is no separate entity to model
				terms.*)
