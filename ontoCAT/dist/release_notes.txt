	FIX: CachedOntologyService -> OntologyTermContext was not serializable
	FIX: BioportalOntologyService would not populate ontologyAccession in getAllTerms()
	FIX: include sources inside the distribution so that javadoc shows up properly

Version 0.9.5.2, 24/9/2010
	FIX: Fixed inconsistency when getOntologyAccession() was not in the list of 
	possible accessions of an OWL file thus preventing some of the methods from completing
	
Version 0.9.5.1, 24/9/2010
	FIX: getAnnotations() would result in IndexOutOfBoundsException in some cases
	FIX: Updated to recent BioPortal web services signature for OntologyBean - authorSlot
	FIX: Various fixes to javadoc

Version 0.9.5, 22/9/2010
	Added support for labels being part of the class URI
	FIX: removed unnecessary eager fetching on some of the methods in BioportalOntologyService
	(e.g. getParents, getChildren where the return list was post-processed on 
	individual term	basis)
	FIX: updated to the latest BioPortal service signature, i.e. instances XML
	Less warnings on using unoptimised getAllParents and getAllChildren

Version 0.9.4, 10/08/2010

		-drops metadata EXACT, RELATED [] etc from synonyms
	Removed a bottleneck in OLS.searchOntology to speed up queries
	Extended OntologyService interface with getAllTerms(), getAllChildren(), getAllParents()
		-FileOntologyService has optimised versions for all three
		-BioportalOntologySerice only implements getAllTerms() through paging
		-all other cases are emulated in a slow unopotimized fashion (a warning
		is issued)
